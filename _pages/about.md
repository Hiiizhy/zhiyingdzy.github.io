# About Me
I am a lecture of Central China Normal University.
I graduated from School of Computer Science and Technology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan China, with a doctor's degree, advised by Jianjun Li.
My research interests include recommender systems, user behavior analysis, and smart education. 
I have served as a PC member for conferences and journals including NeurIPS, ICML, SIGIR, KDD, ACM MM, AAAI, RecSys, DASFAA, TKDE and BDMA, etc.




My research interest includes:
- Recommendation System
- User behavior analysis
- Smart Education
